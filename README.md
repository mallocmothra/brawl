This is the source code to make the Gunfighter/Brawl module version 2.0A, for Major BBS version 6.something.
The data files are not supplied in this repo, and you must own an original licensed copy of the Gunfighter module in order to run it.

The source code was lost long ago, but I spent the last month disassembling, decompiling, and cleaning up the code.
It produces an exact binary replica of the original file, presuming you use the Borland Turbo C++ 3.1 compiler.
I did this work in order to preserve the game, and better understand how it works.

This code is for educational purposes only. I cannot claim ownership of it, and cannot authorize you to use it in any way.
